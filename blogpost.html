					An empty inbox, for me, has the same effect as a really good meditation session. The anxiety melts away and leaves me feeling so much more on top of things. That's why I like my inbox to be at zero or as close to that as it can be.
				</p>	<p class="blog-copy">
					Managing emails can be a real time suck! But often spending time in our inboxes isn’t the best use of our time. If you find yourself using your inbox as your to-do list, this video will help you get that inbox back under control so that you can start setting your daily to-do lists rather than your emails. 				</p>

					Let’s get your inbox to zero</h3>

					<ol>
						<li class="blog-bullets">Grab a cuppa and set aside an hour or two to attack your emails (depending how many emails you’ve got in your inbox)</li>
						<li class="blog-bullets">Start by going through your inbox and deleting any emails you don’t need and unsubscribe to any mailing lists you don’t want to be on</li>
						<li class="blog-bullets">Create some folders to organise your emails into, based on the types of topics you tend to get emails about. </li>
						<li class="blog-bullets">Go through your emails again and move the relevant emails into your new folders. Keep doing that until your inbox is just left with the emails that you need to reply to or take action on</li>
						<li class="blog-bullets">Action the remaining emails in your inbox and as you action them file them into your folders. Keep going until you’re inbox is at zero. Yes, this is going to be the tough bit, but just know that the inbox zero feeling is SO worth it.</li>
						</ol>
						<h3 class="bullet-titles">
						Keeping your inbox at zero</h3>
						<ol>
							<li class="blog-bullets">Get into the habit of closing your emails while you're working and only opening them when you’re ready to send some time responding to, sending and managing your emails</li>
							<li class="blog-bullets">Delete your business emails from your phone to stop them from distracting you and to help you create more structure around when you respond to them</li>
							<li class="blog-bullets">Have a think about when you want to respond to emails and manage your inbox. For example, I respond to my emails between 4-5 on my working days and I make people aware of that by including it in my email signature</li>
							<li class="blog-bullets">Get more selective with the emails you respond to and the emails you keep.  Not every email needs a response or needs to be kept, so get trigger happy with that delete button</li>
